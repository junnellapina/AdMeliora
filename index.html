            <p>Having an outline is a vital step in preparing for a live-stream as it gives it a sense of organization. It lets the streamers efficiently organize and divide their stream into varying parts, making the flow of the stream orderly. The importance of an outline is crucial to the audience as well since it lets them have an overview of what our stream will cover, which may be a determining factor  in whether or not they will tune in.  As such, below we have prepared a stream outline for our first live stream.</p>

      <p>5-day countdown poster - Prior to our livestream, we will be sharing posters each day for 5 days, which will mark as a countdown. 
        We'll be utilizing digital platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and sending out emails to quickly promote our content to a large audience and hopefully intrigue them into tuning into our stream.
        The main ways of promoting our livestream will be through digital networks and sending emails. These digital platforms are easily accessible for many to see, making it an ideal way to promote our 
        livestream and gain more of an audience. Our livestream not only discusses our high school experiences, but also incorporates interactivity with the viewers to make our content more engaging and relatable</p>
