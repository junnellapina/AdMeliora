            <p>Having an outline is a vital step in preparing for a live-stream, especially during an interview, since it gives both the interviewer and the interviewee a sense of what to talk about and when. It helps to prepare both parties for the interview, which enables the audience to hear a much more thorough and high-quality interview and, as a result, obtain better information. As a result, our team has prepared the schedule for our very first live-stream, which is displayed below.</p>
